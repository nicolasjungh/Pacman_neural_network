# Pacman_neural_network
Neural network playing pacma on the python gym environment

This neural network was written as part of a university project. The goal was to write a neural network capable of playing pacman on pythons gym environment 
(https://www.gymlibrary.dev/) using deep Q learning with an agent and a target network.
